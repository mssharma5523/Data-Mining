# Data-Mining
This contains the project work for the Data Mining course. Each of the files contain a read me and has sufficient instruction for
running the code. The data set is generated internally but can be easily taken as input. Also presently the code is for two-dimen-
sional data only. Can be easily extended. And for the distributed version, please setup the map reduce hadoop architecture to run 
the code.
